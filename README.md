## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Regional Sales Analysis** project! This end-to-end data analytics project leverages 5 years of historical U.S. sales data to uncover actionable insights through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

The goal? 📈  
To **understand regional performance**, **optimize product/channel strategies**, and **drive data-driven decisions**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Despite strong product offerings, inconsistent revenue and profitability across U.S. regions raised questions:
- ❓ Which regions or products perform best?
- 📉 Why are there seasonal dips in performance?
- 💡 How can we make smarter marketing and sales decisions?

---

## 🧠 Our Approach

The project follows a two-phase strategy:

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and merged multiple datasets
- Engineered new features like `profit` and `profit_margin_pct`
- Analyzed trends across products, regions, channels, and customers
- Visualized sales patterns, seasonality, and top SKUs

### 2️⃣ Interactive Power BI Dashboard
- Self-service insights for stakeholders
- Real-time slicing by product, region, and time
- Strategic views on revenue, margins, and customer segments

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- 📅 **Seasonality:** Revenue dips in January; peaks in May–June
- 💼 **Top SKUs:** Products 25 & 26 contribute ~25% of sales
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Customer Value:** Aibox Company dominates with high revenue
- 🌎 **Regional Wins:** California leads in both revenue & orders
- 🔄 **Channel Mix:** Wholesale generates 54% of sales, but Export has higher margins

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- 🎯 Focus marketing on peak/off-peak seasons
- 📦 Expand successful SKUs; retire low-margin products
- 💰 Review pricing for large accounts with lower profit margins
- 🌐 Replicate high-performing states' strategies in underperforming regions
